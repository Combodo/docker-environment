## Open a terminal inside the WSL2 host

Inside PHPStorm's terminal pane, using the dropdown arrow allows you to select the `dockered-itop` WSL2 host, where you can run commands to [install iTop](./itop_installation.md).

## Xdebug
Open the iTop project in PHPStorm.

### Debugger
In PHPStorm settings, under PHP > Debug, you can uncheck these options :
- Xdebug
  - [ ] Force break at first line when no path mapping specified
  - [ ] Force break at first line when a script is outside the project
- Evaluation
  - Settings
    - [ ] Notify if debug session was finished without being paused

### Servers
In PHPStorm settings, under PHP > Servers, add a new server with the following configuration :
- Host : localhost
- Port : 88
- Debugger : Xdebug


Check the following option to configure path mappings :
- [X] Use path mappings (select if the server is remote or symlinks are used)
- Add a target to the default option from `//wsl.localhost/dockered-itop/home/{your-username}/docker_environment/html/iTop` (which should already be filled in with the appropriate user) to `/var/www/html/iTop`.
